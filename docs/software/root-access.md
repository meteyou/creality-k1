# Root access

K3B has released a tool to unlock root access. Furthermore, with this tool, you can also downgrade the version of the
printer. This may be necessary if your printer is above version 1.2.9.15. After this version, Creality tried removing
the possibility of using the printer correctly.

Here you can find the original video of K3B: [link to YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8qqrK7eC1E){:target="_blank"}

Open the html file and put your IP address into the input line. Then you can click `Method A`. If your printer has a
newer version than 1.2.9.15, please use the downgrade function.

## Test SSH connection

Open your SSH client of choice and try to connect with the user `root` and the password `creality`.
