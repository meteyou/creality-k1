# Slicer

Creality offers its slicer for the K1 with ready-to-use profiles. This slicer looks like a Cura fork. Even after these
adjustments to this guide, it should still be usable. Since I prefer Prusaslicer (or Orcaslicer) instead of a Cura, I
adapted the default profile from the Creality slicer to my needs.
