# Extruder Grip

The Creality K1 I tested had massive problems with the grip of the extruder gears. On newer models, this problem may
have already been fixed. I then came across this video:

By default, the distance between the two filament gears is too large, and the filament has too little contact pressure. Due to the washer of one gear, they are no longer aligned, and the space between them for the filament is reduced. This results in a higher contact pressure of the gears on the filament.
